UpdateBuddy goal is to provide an *elegant* and *non-obtrusive* solution to install software and system updates on user devices.

It allows you to:

- Notify users when they have updates ready to be installed
- Let the users defer the installation of the updates up to a fixed number of times
- Prevent your users from using their Mac during the installation of updates
- Provide status on the software that is currently being installed
- Display important information

It currently supports Jamf Pro and it's based on SplashBuddy and scripts by HomeBySix.
